# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **This is NOT the Next.js you know.** This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Step-by-step:** Break tasks into small modules — do not generate the entire feature at once.
2. **Type safety:** Strict TypeScript. No `any`, no shortcuts.
3. **English only:** All code, comments, and UI strings must be in English — never Italian.
4. **Verify before moving on:** After each major step, confirm it works before proceeding.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Next.js dev server (port 3002)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run test         # Vitest unit tests (tests/unit/)
npm run test:watch   # Vitest watch mode
```

Database and services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d                          # Postgres (5435) + Redis (6379)
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only --name <name>   # Generate migration WITHOUT applying — always use this first, see Known Gotchas
npx prisma migrate dev                                # Apply after stripping the bogus searchVector lines (see Known Gotchas)
npx prisma migrate deploy                     # Apply existing migrations
npx prisma generate                           # Regenerate client after schema changes
```

Manual integration checks (`tsconfig.test.json` uses CommonJS — main tsconfig uses ESM, so this runs under its own config via `tsx`):

```bash
npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.test.json tests/test-rss.ts
```

## Verification Order

1. `npm run test` + `npm run lint`
2. `npm run build` for framework/route/component changes
3. `npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.test.json tests/test-rss.ts` for RSS changes
4. After Prisma changes: create migration + `npx prisma generate`
5. When adding a new searchable text field: extend the generated `tsvector` column's migration SQL (see `prisma/migrations/*_add_fulltext_search`) and the corresponding branch query in `src/lib/search.ts`
6. Update this file when behavior or workflow changes

## Architecture

**Stack:** Next.js 16.2, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4, PostgreSQL 16 (native full-text search — `tsvector`/GIN, no separate search service), Prisma 7 (`@prisma/adapter-pg`), NextAuth v4 (JWT), Docker.

**Route structure:**

```
src/app/
  [lang]/(marketing)/     Localized public marketing site (en/it) at /[lang]
    page.tsx              Landing page
    blog/, guide/, sources/, tips/   Marketing content pages
  u/[username]/           Private dashboard shell (layout.tsx enforces auth + username match)
    page.tsx              Feed list (all feeds)
    category/[slug]/      Category-filtered feed
    source/[slug]/        Source-filtered feed
    read/[itemId]/        Reader Mode — full extracted article text (Readability); FeedItem by default, or a SavedLink when the URL has `?type=savedLink`
    saved/                Reading list (saved links)
    suggested/            Suggested feeds directory
    settings/
      account/            Account security settings (password, danger zone)
      api-keys/           Personal access tokens for external tools (Premium)
      import-export/      RSS sources (OPML/CSV) and saved links (Pocket/Instapaper/CSV) import & export — ImportModal.tsx is the shared drop-zone/file-picker modal; linked from SettingsMenu.tsx
  u/add/route.ts          Public-page resume target: adds a feed source (by direct URL, or by SUGGESTED_FEEDS "category|name" key for bulk) after /login?callbackUrl=... completes
  u/save-link/route.ts    Public-page resume target: saves an external URL (same /login?callbackUrl=... pattern as u/add) after authentication. General-purpose mirror of u/add for the save side — not currently called from anywhere (the blog Digest rubric resumes inline instead, see blog.ts below)
  login|register|forgot-password|reset-password|verify-email/
  share-target/           PWA share-target endpoint (share links into the app)
  docs/route.ts           Scalar API reference UI, served from /api/openapi
  api/
    auth/[...nextauth]/   NextAuth handler
    categories/route.ts   Category CRUD
    feeds/sources/route.ts  Feed source CRUD
    saved/route.ts, saved/[id]/tags/route.ts   Saved links + tagging
    cron/sync/route.ts    Bearer-token cron (CRON_SECRET), syncs stale feeds
    internal/revalidate/route.ts  Internal-secret-gated cache revalidation
    search/route.ts       Full-text search (Postgres, see src/lib/search.ts)
    health/route.ts       Health check for deploy pipeline
    openapi/route.ts      OpenAPI schema
  actions/                Server Actions, split by domain (each file has its own 'use server')
    types.ts              Shared ActionState type
    shared.ts              frontpageTag() cache-tag helper
    auth.ts                 Register, verify email, password reset
    categories.ts           Category CRUD
    feeds.ts                Feed source CRUD, discovery, sync — addDigestFeedSource() is the plain-args variant called imperatively from DigestCard
    feed-items.ts           Read/unread, save/unsave, front-page dismiss, getReaderArticle() for Reader Mode (FeedItem or SavedLink, by kind param)
    saved-links.ts          External link saving, page title resolution — saveExternalLink() (Server Action) + saveExternalLinkForUser() (Route Handler variant, used by u/save-link) + saveDigestLink() (plain-args variant, called imperatively from DigestCard)
    csv.ts                  Feed CSV import/export + saved-links CSV import/export (import also alias-matches Pocket/Instapaper-shaped headers, incl. Instapaper's headerless variant)
    opml.ts                 OPML import/export for RSS sources — importFeedsOpml()/exportFeedsOpml(); parsing lives in src/lib/opml.ts
    tags.ts                 Tag CRUD, tag assignment to links/items
    starter-packs.ts        Onboarding starter pack add/undo
    digest.ts                getDigestStatus() — read-only, resolves per-item SAVE/ADD FEED state for the blog Digest rubric; called imperatively from DigestCard, not a mutation

src/lib/
  auth.ts                 NextAuth options + custom Prisma adapter (auto-generates username)
  prisma.ts               Prisma singleton (pg.Pool + @prisma/adapter-pg)
  rss.ts                  Feed URL validation (DNS + private IP check) + ingestion/sync; safeFetchText() also used by reader.ts
  reader.ts               getReadableArticle() — Reader Mode: SSRF-guarded fetch + Readability extraction + sanitize-html, Redis-cached (7-day TTL, keyed by article link)
  search.ts               searchAllForUser() — Postgres full-text search (tsvector/GIN) across FeedItem + SavedLink, parameterized $queryRaw
  opml.ts                 Dependency-free OPML parse/build (parseOpml/buildOpml) — regex-scans <outline> elements, never processes DOCTYPE/entities so an uploaded file can't trigger XXE
  email.ts                Password reset via Resend
  utils.ts                slugify (uses underscores), isPrivateIp, PASSWORD_REGEX, decodeHtmlEntities, getHost, sanitizeCallbackUrl
  auth-resume-links.ts    buildLoginResumeHref/buildAddFeedHref/buildSaveLinkHref — "log in, then finish this action" links for logged-out visitors. buildAddFeedHref (→ u/add) is used by the public /sources directory (MarketingSourcesFinder); buildSaveLinkHref (→ u/save-link) currently has no caller. The blog Digest rubric (DigestCard) reuses only the bare buildLoginResumeHref, pointed back at the post itself instead of at u/add/u/save-link — see blog.ts below
  domain-gate.ts          Semaphore: max 2 concurrent requests per hostname
  rate-limit.ts           Redis-backed rate limiter (checkRateLimit) for login/password reset/reader mode
  i18n/                   Dictionary-based i18n (en/it) for marketing routes; Dictionary["digest"] holds the SAVE/ADD FEED button strings for the blog Digest rubric
  blog.ts                 Markdown blog post loader. A post's optional `digestItems` frontmatter array (id/title/url/sourceName/feedUrl?/feedCategory?/blurb?, `id` required) drives the "MultivRSS Digest" rubric: the body places each pick inline with a `::digest[id]` marker on its own line; renderPostSegments() splits content on those markers into an ordered [{prose html} | {digest item}] list (any digestItems entry never referenced by a marker is appended at the end, frontmatter order) and throws — failing `next build` — if a marker references an unknown id. Rendered by src/components/marketing/DigestCard.tsx (DigestProvider + DigestCard) as SAVE + (if feedUrl set) ADD FEED cards: saved/subscribed status is resolved client-side after hydration via getDigestStatus() (src/app/actions/digest.ts) — blog pages are static and shared across users, so this can't be baked in at build time — and the two buttons call saveDigestLink()/addDigestFeedSource() imperatively (optimistic UI, no reload). A logged-out click redirects through /login?callbackUrl=<post path>?intent=save|feed&... and DigestCard's intent-resume effect finishes the action on return. Spec: public/design-handoffs/design_handoff_digest
  frontpage.ts            Landing page data (stats, featured content)
  suggested-feeds.ts      Suggested feeds directory data
  youtube.ts              YouTube feed source support
  queue.ts, redis.ts      Background job queue (Redis-backed)
  revalidate.ts           Shared cache revalidation helpers
  cors.ts                 CORS handling for the extension/share-target origin

src/workers/feed-sync.ts  Background worker process for feed syncing
src/proxy.ts              Request proxy (Next.js 16 convention — not middleware.ts)
tests/unit/               Vitest unit tests
```

**Key conventions:**

- `src/proxy.ts` replaces `middleware.ts` in Next.js 16. Do not create a new `middleware.ts`.
- `params` in route segments is `Promise<{ slug: string }>` — must be awaited.
- `cacheComponents: true` in `next.config.ts`. Use `"use cache"` + `cacheLife` + `cacheTag` for cacheable server output. Use `connection()` to defer to request time when needed.
  - Do not put request-specific or private data inside a shared `"use cache"` scope.
- Call `revalidatePath()` / `revalidateTag()` **before** `redirect()` — redirect throws and skips subsequent calls.
- Server Components by default. `"use client"` only for interactive forms. Server Actions handle all mutations.
- Full-text search is native Postgres: `FeedItem.searchVector`/`SavedLink.searchVector` are `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED` `tsvector` columns (see `prisma/migrations/*_add_fulltext_search`), populated automatically on every insert/update — no separate indexing step or sync-on-write call needed anywhere.
- Category names stored uppercase. `slugify()` uses underscores, not hyphens. Route lookup replaces hyphens with spaces when resolving slugs.

## Auth & Security — Mandatory

Every Server Action, route handler, and server component touching private data must call `getServerSession(authOptions)` and scope queries through the ownership chain:

```
User → Category → FeedSource → FeedItem
```

Never trust client-supplied IDs. Always filter by `userId`.

- **Cron sync** (`/api/cron/sync`): `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}`
- **Feed URLs:** treat as untrusted — `validateFeedUrl()` checks syntax, DNS, private IPv4/IPv6 ranges (SSRF guard). Apply the same check before fetching arbitrary URLs — used by both `resolvePageTitle` and `reader.ts`'s `getReadableArticle`.
- **Password reset:** never reveal whether an email exists (always respond generically).
- **Server Actions:** validate + normalize inputs at the top of each action.
- **Raw SQL:** only via Prisma's parameterized `$queryRaw`/`$executeRaw` tagged templates (`Prisma.sql`/`Prisma.join`/`Prisma.empty` for conditional fragments) — needed for Postgres full-text search (`tsvector`/`ts_rank_cd`/`ts_headline`, see `src/lib/search.ts`). Never use `$queryRawUnsafe` or string-concatenate values into SQL text; bind parameters, don't interpolate.
- **Dependencies:** prefer minimal. Flag any new package with known CVEs or excessive permissions.
- **Infrastructure:** no service (Postgres, Redis) exposed to public internet. All inter-service on internal Docker network.
- **Nginx headers in production:** `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`.
- Secrets live only in `.env` / `.env.production` — never in code, logs, or committed files.

## OWASP Secure Development — Mandatory

Apply OWASP Top 10 to every feature, route, and Server Action:

1. **Input validation** — validate + sanitize + normalize at the boundary. Use `validateFeedUrl()`, regex checks, length limits, type coercion.
2. **Authentication & session** — `getServerSession(authOptions)` on every private endpoint. JWT in httpOnly cookie. No token in URL params or Referrer.
3. **Authorization (broken access control)** — always scope by `userId`. Never use client-supplied IDs without ownership check.
4. **Injection** — Prisma parameterized queries by default; raw SQL (full-text search) only via `$queryRaw` tagged templates with bound parameters, never string concatenation. Never interpolate into shell commands.
5. **SSRF** — `validateFeedUrl()` blocks RFC 1918, loopback, link-local. Apply same guard to `resolvePageTitle` and `reader.ts`.
6. **Security headers** — CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy in Nginx or `next.config.ts`.
7. **Error handling** — never expose stack traces or DB errors to the client. Generic messages externally; structured logging internally.
8. **Cryptography** — passwords hashed via bcrypt (NextAuth). No custom crypto. JWT secret via env var only.
9. **Rate limiting** — login, password reset, API endpoints rate-limited at Nginx level; app-level via `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` for sensitive actions.
10. **Dependency hygiene** — `npm audit` before each deploy. Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

## Accessibility Checklist — Mandatory

Every new component, page, or feature must satisfy these before merge. Treat failures as blocking.

### Semantic HTML
- [ ] Landmark elements used appropriately (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, etc.)
- [ ] Heading hierarchy strict: h1 → h2 → h3 (never skip levels)
- [ ] Exactly one `<h1>` per page
- [ ] Skip-to-content link at top of every layout
- [ ] `<html lang="en">` set in root layout

### Forms & Inputs
- [ ] Every `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>` has `<label htmlFor>` (use `sr-only` if hidden)
- [ ] Error messages associated via `aria-describedby`
- [ ] Error/success container has `role="alert"`
- [ ] Placeholder never used as sole label

### Keyboard & Focus
- [ ] All interactive elements reachable by keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape, arrow keys)
- [ ] `:focus-visible` outline defined — never `outline-none` without a custom focus style
- [ ] Custom dropdowns implement WAI-ARIA focus management (arrow keys, Escape)
- [ ] Modals implement focus trap
- [ ] Elements hidden on hover (`opacity-0 group-hover:`) also visible on `group-focus-within:`

### ARIA
- [ ] No redundant ARIA (use native semantics where possible)
- [ ] `aria-label` values descriptive and contextual (not generic like "Menu")
- [ ] Multiple `<nav>` landmarks have distinct `aria-label` values
- [ ] Decorative overlay elements have `aria-hidden="true"`

### Color & Contrast
- [ ] Text < 18pt / 14px bold: contrast ≥ 4.5:1
- [ ] Text ≥ 18pt or 14pt bold: contrast ≥ 3:1
- [ ] No information conveyed by color alone
- [ ] Dark mode has its own contrast-verified color tokens

### Dynamic Content

- [ ] Optimistic updates (read/save toggle) announced via `aria-live`
- [ ] Empty states: `role="status"`
- [ ] Page title changes per route via `generateMetadata()`

### Images & Media
- [ ] All `<img>` have `alt` (descriptive for informational, `alt=""` for decorative)

## Data Model

- `Category`: unique per user `[userId, name]`
- `FeedSource`: unique by `[categoryId, url]`, globally unique `slug`
- `FeedItem`: unique by `[sourceId, externalId]` (NOT globally unique) — `externalId` used to deduplicate on upsert
- `PasswordResetToken`: per-user
- `Tag`: user-scoped; applied to both `SavedLink` and `FeedItem` via join tables
- Cascade deletes: `Category → FeedSource → FeedItem`
- Indexes on `FeedItem.sourceId` and `FeedItem.pubDate`
- `FeedItem.searchVector` / `SavedLink.searchVector`: generated `tsvector` columns (GIN-indexed, `'simple'` config, title weighted `A` over content/description weighted `B`) — declared `Unsupported("tsvector")?` in `schema.prisma`; the `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED` expression and GIN index exist only in hand-written migration SQL, not the Prisma schema DSL

## Design System

- **Base:** `#000000` + `#FFFFFF`. No grays, no shadows, no border-radius.
- **Accent:** Terracotta `#E2725B` — text/borders only, never backgrounds. Avoid opacity below `/55` for text (contrast drops below 4.5:1 on paper background `#F6F3EC`).
- **Font:** Inter via `--font-inter`. Headings: bold, all-caps, wide tracking.
- **Layout:** Sharp 2px horizontal borders. No rounded corners.
- **Tailwind v4:** configured via `@import "tailwindcss"` + `@theme inline` in `src/app/globals.css`.
- **Inspiration:** Frank Lloyd Wright — black/white base with sparse organic palette for headings and accents.
- **Components:** Inputs and buttons feel "built into" the layout — not floating or superimposed.

## Known Gotchas

- `docs/` is local-by-default: `.gitignore`'s `/docs/*` block ignores everything under it and then allow-lists only the published files (`self-hosting.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `deploy-strategy.md`, `backup-strategy.md`, `launch-plan.md`). Any other file dropped in `docs/` — `docs/notes.md`, `docs/MARKETING_PLAN.md`, `docs/CICD.md`, `docs/EDITORIAL.md`, `docs/OPEN_SOURCE_PLAN.md`, and anything new — stays local and is never committed. Same for `AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md` if a CLI tool writes them at the repo root.
- No `opencode.json` in the repo.
- `slugify()` uses underscores; category names stored uppercase; route lookup replaces hyphens with spaces.
- `.env.example` lists every required var with a note on where to obtain each; the local `.env` holds the real values.
- Untracked `.codex` path exists — do not delete or modify.
- Blog posts are published by branching off `main` (not `dev`) so a release doesn't drag in whatever app work is pending on `dev` — see `docs/EDITORIAL.md` "Publishing Workflow". A post still always requires a full rebuild+redeploy: `content/blog/**` is read via synchronous `fs` calls at `next build` time (`generateStaticParams`, no `"use cache"`/revalidate), and the running container has no runtime filesystem access to `content/` at all.
- **`prisma migrate dev` reliably corrupts on every run** because of `FeedItem.searchVector`/`SavedLink.searchVector` (`Unsupported("tsvector")`, `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED`, hand-written in `prisma/migrations/*_add_fulltext_search`). Prisma's diff engine always proposes `DROP INDEX "FeedItem_searchVector_idx"` / `DROP INDEX "SavedLink_searchVector_idx"` + `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN "searchVector" DROP DEFAULT` — this fires even when the schema change is unrelated to search, and even on a second `migrate dev` run right after a clean apply. Postgres rejects the `DROP DEFAULT` on a generated column (error `42601`), but the `DROP INDEX` statements are NOT protected by that failure and commit for real, silently deleting the GIN indexes backing full-text search. Always run `prisma migrate dev --create-only --name <name>` first, delete the spurious `DropIndex`/`AlterTable searchVector` lines from the generated `migration.sql` by hand, then run `prisma migrate dev` (no args) to apply. If the indexes do get dropped, recreate them manually (exact SQL in `prisma/migrations/*_add_fulltext_search/migration.sql`) — do not reach for `prisma migrate reset`, it wipes all local data and is never necessary for this issue.
- **Browser/router back-forward navigation can resurrect stale modal state.** Next.js always reuses a route segment's cached client render on back/forward navigation (`router.back()`, or the browser's own back button) to preserve scroll position — this is undocumented-but-real behavior distinct from `staleTimes`, which only governs *forward* navigation freshness (see `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/05-config/01-next-config-js/staleTimes.md` and the `04-glossary.md` "Client Cache" entry). Any modal/popover whose visibility is local `useState` (not tied to the URL) can therefore reappear after navigating away and back, even though it was explicitly closed before leaving. Fix: call `useCloseOnNavigate(closeFn)` (`src/components/useCloseOnNavigate.ts`) in any component that owns that kind of visibility state — it force-closes on every pathname change. Already applied everywhere `AssignTagsModal` is rendered from local state (`AddPopover`, `FeedItem`, `FrontPageItemActions`, `SavedView`, `SearchBar`, `ReaderActions`, `ShareTargetModal`); apply it to any new modal built the same way.
  - **`useCloseOnNavigate` alone does not cover an effect that reopens a modal by watching a `useActionState` result.** Confirmed live (fixed in `AddPopover.tsx`, reported as "Back to feed" from the installed PWA on Linux resurrecting the EDIT_SAVED_LINK tag modal): when the cached segment above is restored, React re-runs that segment's effects — including ones with unchanged dependencies — as part of redisplaying it, the same way effects always run on mount. `useCloseOnNavigate`'s own pathname-diff effect correctly force-closes on this replay, but a *second*, independent effect that opens the modal by checking `if (saveState?.success) { setX(saveState.link); ... }` re-runs too and immediately reopens it, because `saveState` (from `useActionState`) still holds the old resolved "success" value from before — nothing ever cleared it, and it's preserved across the replay same as any other `useState`. `useCloseOnNavigate` can't fix this because the problem isn't "the modal didn't close," it's "a second unrelated effect reopened it right after." Fix at the source: guard that effect with a ref tracking the last `saveState` object it actually acted on (`if (saveState?.success && saveState.link && handledRef.current !== saveState) { handledRef.current = saveState; ... }`), so a replay of the identical object is a no-op. Apply this to any future component pairing `useActionState` with an effect that opens transient UI on success. Same fix applied to `ShareTargetModal.tsx` (2026-08-15, reported as saving a link from the mobile PWA's share-target flow appearing to "not complete" when a second share reused the same window — the stale success `saveState` from the first save was reopening the first link's `EDIT_SAVED_LINK` modal instead of processing the second link).
- **`cacheComponents` keeps up to 3 recently-visited routes mounted under `<Activity mode="hidden">` — a page that seeds server data into `useState` goes stale while hidden.** Different symptom, same family as the modal gotcha above. `cacheComponents: true` makes Next.js hide the previous route instead of unmounting it (see `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/02-guides/preserving-ui-state.md`), so its `useState` survives a navigation away and back — the preserved state never re-reads its props, and server-side revalidation (`revalidatePath`/`updateTag`) can't touch a client component that isn't re-rendering. Confirmed live 2026-09-03: save an article from the feed list, soft-navigate to `/u/[username]/saved`, and the newly-saved item is missing until a hard refresh — `SavedPageClient` held the list in `useState(initial*)` and `/saved` was sitting hidden with the pre-save state. Fix: `useOnReshow(refetchCb)` (`src/components/useOnReshow.ts`) — React re-runs effects on every hidden→visible transition, so this fires a refetch-and-reseed callback on each reshow while skipping the initial mount. Applied in `SavedPageClient.tsx` (refetches page 1 via `getMoreSavedItems({feedOffset:0,linkOffset:0})` + `getTags()`). Apply it to any page that seeds a server list into `useState` and can be mutated from elsewhere in the app.

## Docker

**Local** (`docker-compose.yml`):
- Postgres `postgres:16-alpine` on host port `5435`, container `multivrss-db`
- Redis on host port `6379`, container `multivrss-redis`
- App runs outside Docker: `npm run dev` on port `3002`
- Local env vars: `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`

**Prod/Staging** (`docker-compose.prod.yml`):
- All services on `internal` network — no public ports for DB or Redis
- App at `127.0.0.1:3001:3000` (loopback only, Nginx in front)
- Alternate env file: `ENV_FILE=.env.staging docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
- Adminer: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile tools up -d adminer`

**CI/CD pipeline:** push to `dev` → single workflow run: quality-gate (tsc, lint, test, audit) → Docker build → GHCR push → SSH deploy (sync compose file from git, prisma migrate, docker compose pull + up --force-recreate, health check on `localhost:3001`, auto-rollback on failure). Push to `main` runs the same pipeline targeting production. PRs trigger quality-gate only (no deploy).

## Versioning & Changelog

Versioning is manual — `release-please` was tried and removed (repo policy blocks GitHub Actions from opening PRs), so don't re-propose CI-based auto-bumping/auto-changelog without solving that constraint first.

Commit messages should start with a Conventional Commits prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.) — `scripts/changelog-draft.sh` groups commits by this prefix (`feat`→Added, `fix`→Fixed, everything else→Changed); non-conventional commits all fall into the Changed catch-all.

**Release checklist**, in order:

1. Bump `version` in `package.json`, commit it (with any other final release changes).
2. Run `npm run changelog:draft` (defaults to since the last `multivrss-v*` tag → `HEAD`; pass explicit refs only if no tag exists yet).
3. Review/edit the printed draft, paste it into `CHANGELOG.md` under a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading.
4. Rewrite the same changes in plain, non-technical language under a new `## vX.Y.Z — Month Year` heading in `content/changelog/en.md` and `content/changelog/it.md` (`**New**` / `**Improved**` bullet groups).
5. Optional, for notable releases: write a narrative announcement post in `content/blog/en/` and `content/blog/it/` (see the `0.2.0` posts for the format — matching `translationSlug` frontmatter links the two languages).
6. Commit the changelog/content updates, then tag the release: `git tag multivrss-vX.Y.Z && git push origin multivrss-vX.Y.Z` — this is what keeps step 2 automatic (no manual ref) for the next release.
